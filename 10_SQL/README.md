# Structured Query Language SQL:
Talks with the databases like:
* SQL Server
* Oracle
* MySQL, etc.

Tools to Write SQL
* SQL Server Management Studio
* SQL Workbench
* SQL developer
* TOAD, etc.

A table in SQL is a type of entity (i.e. Dogs), and each row in that table as a specific *instance* of that type (i.e. A pug, a beagle, a different colored pug, etc.). This means that the columns would then represent the common properties shared by all instances of that entity (i.e. Color of fur, length of tail, etc.)

## `SELECT` queries:
`SELECT` is used to retrieve data from SQL database, and it is also colloquially called as *queries*. Queries contains mainly -> what data we are looking for, where to find it in the database, and optionally transform it before returning.
```sql
/* Select query for a specific multiple columns */
SELECT column, another_col
FROM myTable;

/* to select all the columns from a table */
SELECT *
FROM myTable;
```

## Queries with Constraints `WHERE` clause:
The `WHERE` clause is applied to each row of data by checking specific column values to determine whether it should be included in the results or not.
```sql
/* Select query with constraints */
SELECT col1, col2
FROM myTable
WHERE condition
    AND/OR another_condition
    AND/OR ....;
    
/* example */
SELECT *
FROM myTable
WHERE col2='value';
```
Some more complex queries can be made by combining several of ANDs and ORs as shown below:

When doing `WHERE` clauses with the columns containing text data, we have several more sql commands to do selection of the values in the column that works with the strings. See below:

## Filtering and Sorting Query Results:
`DISTINCT` keyword will discard rows that have a duplicate column value.
```sql
/* removes every rows for col1, col2 has same values, need to discard duplicates based on
specific columns then we need to use GROUP BY clause */
SELECT DISTINCT col1, col2
FROM myTable
WHERE condition(s);
```

### Ordering results with `ORDER BY`:
```sql
SELECT col1, col2
FROM myTable
WHERE condition(s)
ORDER BY col1 ASC/DESC;
```
When an `ORDER BY` clause is specified, each row is sorted alpha-numerically based on the specified column's value.

### Limiting results to a subset using `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`:
The `LIMIT` wll reduce the number of rows to return, and the optional `OFFSET` will specify where to begin counting the number of rows from.
```sql
SELECT col1, col2
FROM myTable
WHERE condition(s)
ORDER BY col1 ASC/DESC
LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset;
```
